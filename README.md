# React Clock

This is just a super simple example of a react component that tells the time.

I worked on it to familiarize myself with react as well as SVG.

I planned to use Redux, but it's not used yet.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
npm install
npm start
```

and go to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

## Hosted
